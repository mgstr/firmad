PostgreSQL database with a list of companies registered in Estonia.

Free open data can be downloaded from [Avaandmete portaal](https://opendata.riik.ee/dataset/http-avaandmed-rik-ee-andmed-ariregister) in the form of [compressed CSV file](http://avaandmed.rik.ee/andmed/ARIREGISTER/ariregister_csv.zip).

This project converts this data into PostgresSQL database that is provided as a Docker image for easy consumption.
